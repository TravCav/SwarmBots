The dots are an exploration and study of emergent behavior of evolutionary deep learning neural networks.


See them dots? I gave'm brains! Tiny little stupid brains, but brains nonetheless.


This started out as an idea of what would dots do if I gave them some inputs about their surroundings and a neural network to decide what to do. 


This is the true story, of hundres of dots, picked to live in a browser, eat each other, and have their lives watched. Find out what happens, when pixels stop being polite, and start getting real... 


They start out with no brains and the greyest of greys.

Eventually they develop brains and change colors.

Each dot has it's own unique neural network. 

Dot with most energy consumes dot with less energy.

Consumer get remaining energy.

Consumed dot get slighly mutated brain and color of consumer
