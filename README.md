"The Dots" are an exploration and study into emergent behavior of evolutionary deep learning neural networks.
The similation starts with a number of dots that each have their own neural network. At first all neuron connections have a weight of zero, effectively rendering them devoid of cognitive capacity.
As they run out of energy, they regenerate as the offspring of another dot while copying their color and neural network and slighly modifying the color and one of the weights.
When two dots interact the dot with the most energy will turn the other other dot into an offspring replacing it's color and neural network with slightly modified versions of its own.


or the D&D version

"Welcome, adventurers, to 'The Dots,' an intricate quest that unfurls before you, exploring the enigmatic domain of emergent behavior within evolutionary deep learning neural networks. Imagine a world where dots, each bearing its own neural network, step onto the stage. These neural networks, born with zero-weight connections, are but blank slates in the grand tapestry of cognition.

As you traverse this simulation, guided by the ebbs and flows of energy, you witness a profound rebirth, akin to the passage of generations. These dots, like noble offspring, inherit the coloration and neural network lore of their progenitors while weaving subtle alterations into their very essenceâ€”both in their chromatic hues and the delicate dance of neural weights.

Yet, here, in this realm of dots, your destiny is interwoven with chance encounters. When two dots converge in this dynamic tapestry, a cosmic struggle for supremacy ensues. The one infused with greater energy seizes the reins of fate, forging the other into a descendant. In this moment of transformation, color and neural network attributes are reshaped, their very essence imprinted with the characteristics of the victor.

Brave adventurers, your journey through 'The Dots' is fraught with intrigue, as you navigate the twists and turns of neural networks and emergent behaviors. Your fate, like that of these dots, is ever in flux, and the choices you make shall echo through the annals of this captivating realm."
